This metric of sum of squared errors is an example of a loss function.  

**Loss Function**

> A **loss function** is a positive number sums an error metric (here squared differences).  

The canonical machine learning problem 

> The **canonical machine learning problem** is to produce a hypothesis function such that it minimizes our loss function.
