    "Whenever we are faced with a machine learning algorithm, our first step is to gather data related to the outcome we are trying to predict.  For example, one of the most famous datasets is the breast cancer cell dataset created in 1992 by Dr. Wolberg at the University of Wisconsin.  Dr. Wolberg had look at images of different cells, write down characteristics about them, and then specify whether the cells were cancerous or not.  The idea was to gain learn more information about what characteristics could help to predict whether a cell would become cancerous."
