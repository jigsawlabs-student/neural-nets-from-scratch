    "The structure of a neural network is inspired by the structure of the human brain itself.  And by using this structure, neural networks have been able to bring new applications to the field of machine learning - like labeling pictures, text, or sound waves.  It sounds pretty intimidating - building a software program that inspired by the brain that can achieve such feats.  But as we begin to interpret neural networks, we'll see that many of the core ideas, and what makes a neural a network function are fairly intuitive.  Let's get started."

    "This set of spheres and squiggly lines is the mechanism by which humans interpret the world and think.  Each of those blue spheres is the cell body of a different neuron, where each neuron either fires or does not fire by generating an electrochemical signal.  The firing of an individual neuron influences the firing of a neuron it is connected to.  And this combination of firings or not firings is what composes our thoughts.  So let's start with an individual neuron, an artificial neuron, and develop an understanding for how and what it means for a neuron to fire."
