Well if our neural network is tasked with identifying handwritten digits, we could imagine that the first layer just identifies the regions where a number is drawn.  Then perhaps the second layer has three different neurons, with one neuron to identify horizontal lines, one for vertical lines, and one for curved lines.  And then the third layer could use this information to associate the image with a single digit.  \n",
